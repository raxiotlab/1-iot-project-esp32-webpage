# 1-iot-project-esp32-webpage
This project demonstrates how to control an LED connected to an ESP32 board through a simple web interface. It includes the ESP32 firmware and the frontend webpage with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to send commands to the device over Wi-Fi. The ESP32 acts as a local web server that allows the user to turn the LED on or off using a browser.
